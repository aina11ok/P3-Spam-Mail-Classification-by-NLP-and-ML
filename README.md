# P3-Spam-Mail-Classification-by-NLP-and-ML

<H1>Project Description</H1>

<p>Spam mail classification is the process of automatically classifying emails as spam (unwanted, unsolicited, or potentially harmful) or ham (valid, wanted emails) based on their content, metadata and other features using ML and NLP methods and algorithms</p>

<H2>How to execute the project</H2>

<p>The whole project is spam mail classification. By using the NLP and ML algorithms and various python libraries like numpy, pandas, sklearn, etc we are able to create an application that classifies the given mail into ham or spam. The mail that contains the alphabet is considered ham and the one with both the alphabet and numbers or symbols is considered spam.
The whole application is built in Visual Studio Code and name of the application is Spam detector. The data for the classification is taken from spam.csv file.
The process begins with loading the data file into Visual Studio Code. Then we write the jupyter source file code where we try to fit in the data into the model. Then, we design the application by writing the code into the python source file. In here we also design our application with headings and sub headings. Finally, we run the code in the terminal window. If we find any errors, we tried to debug the errors by browsing on the internet and rerun the program several times until the code was perfect.
We should be able to see the result with the help of the URL’s provided by Streamlit. There are 2 URL’s in total. One is a network URL and the other one is a local URL. Clicking on the URL of your choice takes you to your respective app.
In this way we have created our spam detector application in the streamlit.

<H3>Output</H3>

<p>The given mail is then classified into ham and spam</p>
